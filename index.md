We are a historic-fiction minecraft roleplay server based in the late 1700s.

To roleplay on our server, you don't need to know anything about history, as we are not completely accurate. We plan to have plagues that sweep through the city, wars that people fight in, and so much more!

## Features
- Serious roleplay
- Horse drawn carts
- Player identity cards
- A large main town to roleplay your life in
- A custom resource pack that makes everything look awesome
- General player needs such as health, thirst, bladder, and weight
- So much more!
